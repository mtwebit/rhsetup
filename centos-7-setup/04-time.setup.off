--- Network Time
Having an accurate clock is essential for several applications.
The system is running a cron job to sync time with NTP servers.
  see /etc/cron.d/ntpdate
You can turn on ntpd if needed:
  remove or uncomment the current cron job in /etc/cron.d/ntpdate
  yum -y install ntp
  vi /etc/ntp.conf
  systemctl enable ntp.service && systemctl restart ntp.service
